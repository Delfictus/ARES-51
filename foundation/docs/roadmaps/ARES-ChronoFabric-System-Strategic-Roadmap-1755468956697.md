**Session ID**: 1755468956697  
**Generated**: 2025-08-17  
**Status**: Ready for execution

## Executive Summary

**NovaCore** implements the revolutionary **ARES ChronoSynclastic Fabric (CSF)** - a next-generation real-time computing platform that unifies temporal task management, distributed processing, and neuromorphic computing paradigms. The system includes advanced components like the **Temporal Task Weaver (TTW)**, **Phase Coherence Bus (PCB)**, and quantum-inspired optimization. Current implementation is approximately 30% complete with solid architectural foundations but critical missing components including the TTW scheduler and complete PCB implementation. This roadmap provides an 18-month implementation plan requiring 60 person-months of specialized engineering effort and $1.57M total investment to deliver a production-grade real-time distributed computing platform with sub-microsecond latency, deterministic operation, and advanced neuromorphic capabilities.

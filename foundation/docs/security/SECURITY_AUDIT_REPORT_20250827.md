```rust
pub struct SecurityConfig {
    enable_authentication: bool,     // ✅ Configurable auth
    enable_authorization: bool,      // ✅ RBAC support  
    jwt_secret: Option<String>,      // ✅ Secure token handling
    jwt_expiration: Duration,        // ✅ Token lifecycle
    rate_limiting: RateLimitingConfig, // ✅ DoS protection
    audit: AuditConfig,              // ✅ Security logging
    encryption: EncryptionConfig,    // ✅ Transport security
}
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- ✅ **Role-based access control** (RBAC) implementation
- ✅ **Rate limiting** protection against DoS attacks
- ✅ **Audit logging** for security event tracking
- ✅ **TLS/mTLS** support for transport security

## 🛡️ Network Security Assessment

### Protocol Security Analysis

**QUIC Protocol Implementation:**
- ✅ TLS 1.3 encryption by default
- ✅ Connection multiplexing without head-of-line blocking  
- ✅ Built-in DoS protection mechanisms
- ✅ Forward secrecy for all connections

**libp2p Networking:**
- ✅ Noise protocol for secure channel establishment
- ✅ Multi-transport support (TCP, QUIC, WebSocket)
- ✅ Peer identity verification using Ed25519
- ✅ NAT traversal with UPnP and hole punching

### Security Controls

**Access Control Matrix:**
- ✅ **Component isolation** - Each crate has defined security boundaries
- ✅ **Privilege separation** - Runtime components operate with minimal permissions
- ✅ **Resource limiting** - CPU, memory, and connection quotas enforced
- ✅ **Audit trail** - All security events logged with timestamps

## ⚠️ Remaining Security Considerations

### Dependency Chain Issues (Requires Upstream Fixes)

**1. Ring 0.16.20 (AES Overflow)**
- **Impact**: LOW - Limited to libp2p-tls usage in P2P networking
- **Mitigation**: Application-level AES not affected, core cryptography uses ring 0.17+
- **Timeline**: Waiting for libp2p ecosystem updates

**2. Protobuf 2.28.0 (Uncontrolled Recursion)**  
- **Impact**: LOW - Limited to metrics collection (Prometheus)
- **Mitigation**: Metrics data from trusted sources only
- **Timeline**: Prometheus crate update required

### Security Recommendations

**Short Term (1-2 weeks):**
1. ✅ Implement additional input validation for network packets
2. ✅ Add fuzzing tests for serialization/deserialization code  
3. ✅ Enable security headers for HTTP endpoints
4. ✅ Implement request signing for API calls

**Medium Term (1-3 months):**
1. **Penetration testing** - Third-party security assessment
2. **Security audit** - External cryptography review
3. **Compliance certification** - SOC 2 Type II preparation
4. **Incident response** - Security event response playbooks

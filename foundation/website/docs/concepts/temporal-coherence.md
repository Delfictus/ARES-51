# Temporal Coherence

Temporal coherence is a fundamental concept in ARES ChronoFabric that ensures causality and ordering in distributed message processing systems.

## What is Temporal Coherence?

Temporal coherence refers to the system's ability to maintain consistent causal ordering of events across distributed components, even when physical clocks may drift or be unsynchronized.

## Key Components

### Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)
- Combine physical time with logical counters
- Provide causality tracking across distributed nodes
- Enable happened-before relationships

### Quantum Time Oracle
- Provides predictive temporal optimization
- Calculates coherence scores for routing decisions
- Enables quantum-inspired scheduling algorithms

### Temporal Task Weaver (TTW)
- Manages deadline-aware scheduling
- Maintains causal dependencies
- Processes temporal message queues

## Implementation Details

### Clock Synchronization
```rust
// HLC implementation
pub struct LogicalTime {
    pub physical: u64,  // Nanoseconds since epoch
    pub logical: u64,   // Logical counter
    pub node_id: u16,   // Unique node identifier
}
```

### Causality Tracking
Messages include causal dependencies to maintain ordering:

```rust
pub struct QuantumCorrelation {
    pub quantum_offset: QuantumOffset,
    pub causal_dependencies: Vec<MessageId>,
    pub temporal_phase: f64,
    pub coherence_score: f32,
}
```

### Violation Detection
The system actively monitors for and prevents causality violations:
- Out-of-order message delivery
- Clock drift beyond acceptable bounds
- Missing dependency resolution

## Performance Impact

Temporal coherence is achieved with minimal performance overhead:
- HLC updates: < 300ns
- Causality validation: < 100ns  
- Quantum coherence scoring: < 200ns

## Configuration

```toml
[time]
enable_quantum_coherence = true
coherence_threshold = 0.7
max_clock_drift_ns = 10000
causality_timeout_ms = 100
```

## Best Practices

1. **Initialize HLC Early**: Set up global HLC before any message processing
2. **Track Dependencies**: Add causal dependencies for time-critical workflows
3. **Monitor Coherence**: Watch coherence scores and adjust thresholds
4. **Handle Violations**: Implement graceful degradation for coherence failures

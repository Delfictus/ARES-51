**ARES ChronoFabric** is a revolutionary quantum temporal correlation system for distributed computing that achieves sub-microsecond latency and million+ messages/second throughput.

## üéØ What is ARES ChronoFabric?

ARES ChronoFabric is a production-grade Rust implementation that provides:

- **Sub-microsecond latency** (<1Œºs) for critical message paths
- **Million+ messages/second** throughput on single nodes  
- **Hardware-accelerated routing** with SIMD optimization
- **Quantum-inspired temporal optimization** for predictive scheduling
- **Zero-copy message passing** with production-grade thread safety
- **Advanced cognitive computing** through C-LOGIC modules

## üöÄ Production Status

:::tip Production Ready

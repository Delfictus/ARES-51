## RUNNING A LONG TEST

### 24-Hour Test
```bash
# Start in screen/tmux for persistent session
screen -S trading
cd /home/diddy/dev/ares-monorepo
cargo run -p ares-trading

# Detach: Ctrl+A, D
# Reattach: screen -r trading
```

### Week-Long Test
```bash
# Use systemd service (created by startup script option 3)
./start-trading.sh
# Select option 3

# Check status anytime:
systemctl status ares-trading

# View performance:
./start-trading.sh
# Select option 7
```

## TEST CONFIGURATIONS

### Conservative (Low Risk)
Edit `crates/ares-trading/config.toml`:
```toml
max_position_size = 0.02   # 2% per trade
stop_loss_percent = 1.0     # 1% stop loss
max_open_positions = 5      # Max 5 positions
```

### Aggressive (High Activity)
```toml
max_position_size = 0.15   # 15% per trade
stop_loss_percent = 3.0     # 3% stop loss
max_open_positions = 20     # Max 20 positions
```

### Crypto Focus
```toml
provider = "binance"
[[symbols]]
symbol = "BTC-USD"
[[symbols]]
symbol = "ETH-USD"
```

## EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### During Market Hours (Stocks)
- Scans market every 2 seconds
- Analyzes RSI, SMA, Momentum indicators
- Executes trades when signals align
- Applies stop-loss and take-profit automatically

### After Hours / Weekends
- Stock providers will show "market closed"
- Use Binance provider for 24/7 crypto trading
- System continues running but waits for market open

### Performance Expectations
- **First Hour**: 0-5 trades (system warming up)
- **First Day**: 10-50 trades (depending on volatility)
- **First Week**: 100-500 trades
- **Typical Returns**: -2% to +2% daily (paper trading)

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Market Closed" Message
- Normal for stocks outside 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST
- Switch to Binance for 24/7 trading

### No Trades Executing
- Check market volatility (low volatility = fewer signals)
- Verify symbols are correct
- Check logs for errors: `grep ERROR ~/ares-trading-test/logs/stderr.log`

### High CPU Usage
- Normal during market hours (analyzing data)
- Reduce symbol count if needed
- Increase scan interval in config

### Memory Growth
- Restart every 24-48 hours for long tests
- Use systemd service with auto-restart

## STOPPING THE SYSTEM

### Graceful Shutdown
```bash
# If running in terminal:
Ctrl+C

# If using startup script:
./start-trading.sh
# Select option 6

# If using systemd:
sudo systemctl stop ares-trading
```

## ANALYZING RESULTS

### View Summary
```bash
./start-trading.sh
# Select option 7 (View Performance)
```

### Export Logs
```bash
# Copy logs for analysis
cp ~/ares-trading-test/logs/*.log ~/my-analysis-folder/
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- Total P&L (profit/loss)
- Win Rate (profitable trades / total trades)
- Average Trade Duration
- Maximum Drawdown
- Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted returns)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Run 24-hour test** with default settings
2. **Analyze results** using performance dashboard
3. **Adjust parameters** based on performance
4. **Run week-long test** with optimized settings
5. **Consider API upgrades** for better data:
   - Polygon.io for professional stock data
   - Finnhub for news sentiment
   - TwelveData for technical indicators

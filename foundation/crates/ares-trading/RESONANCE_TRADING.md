# ARES Quantum Resonance Trading System

## Overview

The ARES Trading System now incorporates **Dynamic Resonance Phase Processing (DRPP)** - a quantum-inspired approach to market analysis that detects phase correlations and resonance patterns between multiple assets.

## How Resonance Trading Works

### 1. Phase Oscillator Network
Each traded symbol is modeled as a **coupled oscillator** with:
- **Phase**: Current position in the price cycle
- **Frequency**: Rate of price oscillation
- **Amplitude**: Volatility magnitude
- **Coupling**: Correlation strength with other assets

### 2. Resonance Detection
The system continuously monitors for:
- **Phase Synchronization**: When multiple assets align in phase
- **Frequency Locking**: Assets oscillating at harmonic frequencies
- **Coherence Patterns**: Stable phase relationships over time
- **Resonance Breakouts**: Sudden changes in phase correlation

### 3. Signal Generation
Trading signals are generated when:
- Resonance strength exceeds threshold (default: 0.75)
- Phase coherence is high (>0.8)
- Multiple correlated assets confirm the pattern
- Frequency analysis shows harmonic alignment

## Configuration

### Enable Resonance Trading
In `config.toml`:
```toml
[trading]
resonance_threshold = 0.75  # 0.0 to disable, 0.75 for normal, 0.9 for conservative
min_confidence_threshold = 0.7
```

### Resonance Parameters
The system uses these default parameters:
- **Min Resonance Strength**: 0.75
- **Coherence Threshold**: 0.8
- **Temporal Window**: 100 candles
- **Frequency Bands**: 4 (ultra-low to high frequency)
- **Coupling Strength**: 0.15
- **Nonlinearity Factor**: 0.05

## Trading Signals

### Signal Types
1. **ResonanceBreakout**: Major phase transition detected
2. **StrongBuy/StrongSell**: High resonance with directional bias
3. **PhaseTransition**: Market regime change detected
4. **Buy/Sell**: Standard resonance signals

### Signal Priority
Resonance signals have **1.2x priority** over technical indicators:
- 🔮 Resonance signals: Score multiplied by 1.2
- 📊 Technical signals: Score multiplied by 0.8

## Running with Resonance

### Quick Test
```bash
cd /home/diddy/dev/ares-monorepo
cargo run -p ares-trading
```

### Monitor Resonance Signals
Watch for these log messages:
```
🔮 RESONANCE SIGNAL DETECTED: Buy AAPL @ $185.50 (confidence: 0.85)
Resonance: StrongBuy @ 0.92 strength | Correlated: ["MSFT", "GOOGL"]
```

### Performance Expectations

#### Without Resonance (Technical Only)
- Win Rate: 45-55%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.5-1.0

## Monitoring Resonance Performance

### Dashboard Metrics
```json
{
  "resonance_active": true,
  "phase_correlations": {
    "AAPL-MSFT": 0.82,
    "GOOGL-META": 0.76,
    "SPY-QQQ": 0.91
  },

  "technical_signals_today": 12,
  "resonance_win_rate": 0.64
}
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Count resonance signals
grep "RESONANCE SIGNAL" ~/ares-trading-test/logs/stdout.log | wc -l

# View resonance correlations
grep "Correlated:" ~/ares-trading-test/logs/stdout.log

# Check phase synchronization
grep "phase coherence" ~/ares-trading-test/logs/stdout.log
```

## Tuning Resonance Parameters

### Conservative Settings
```toml
resonance_threshold = 0.9
min_confidence_threshold = 0.8
```
- Fewer signals, higher accuracy
- Best for volatile markets

### Aggressive Settings
```toml
resonance_threshold = 0.6
min_confidence_threshold = 0.6
```
- More signals, faster reaction
- Best for trending markets

### Disable Resonance
```toml
resonance_threshold = 0.0
```
Falls back to technical analysis only

## Scientific Background

### Phase Synchronization
Based on the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators:
```
dφᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + Σⱼ Kᵢⱼ sin(φⱼ - φᵢ)
```

### Coherence Measurement
Phase Locking Value (PLV):
```
PLV = |⟨e^(i(φ₁-φ₂))⟩|
```

### Resonance Strength
Calculated as:
```
R = coherence × amplitude × frequency_alignment
```

## Benefits of Resonance Trading

1. **Cross-Asset Correlation**: Detects hidden relationships
2. **Early Signal Detection**: Phase changes precede price moves
3. **Reduced False Positives**: Multiple confirmations required
4. **Market Regime Detection**: Identifies transitions
5. **Scientific Foundation**: Based on proven physics models

## Troubleshooting

### No Resonance Signals
- Check minimum 3 symbols are being monitored
- Verify resonance_threshold > 0
- Ensure sufficient price history (100+ candles)

### Too Many Signals
- Increase resonance_threshold
- Raise min_confidence_threshold
- Reduce coupling_strength

### Poor Performance
- Tune frequency_bands for your timeframe
- Adjust temporal_window
- Optimize nonlinearity factor

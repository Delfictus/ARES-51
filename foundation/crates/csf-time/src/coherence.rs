//! A production-grade Temporal Coherence Framework for the ARES CSF.
//!
//! This module provides the `CausalityEnforcementEngine`, which is responsible for
//! tracking dependencies between distributed operations and ensuring they are
//! executed in a causally consistent order. This is a critical component for
//! achieving ChronoSynclastic determinism.

## Core Implementation Details

### Risk Assessment Engine Structure
```rust
struct RiskAssessmentEngine {
    risk_factors: Vec<RiskFactor>,
    thresholds: RiskThresholds,
    threat_models: Arc<ThreatModelingEngine>,
    ml_scorer: Arc<MLRiskScorer>,
    vulnerability_scanner: Arc<VulnerabilityScanner>,
    behavioral_analyzer: Arc<BehavioralAnalyzer>,
}
```

### Risk Factor Analysis
1. **Module Criticality** (40% weight)
   - Static analysis of module importance
   - Dependency tree risk assessment
   - Security surface analysis
   - Historical incident correlation

2. **Change Complexity** (30% weight)
   - Code complexity metrics from SMT proofs
   - Architectural impact analysis
   - Change velocity risk assessment
   - Cross-module dependency impact

3. **Verification Confidence** (20% weight)
   - SMT solver confidence analysis
   - Invariant coverage assessment
   - Test coverage correlation
   - Formal verification completeness

4. **System State** (10% weight)
   - Real-time system load analysis
   - Error pattern detection
   - Threat intelligence integration
   - Concurrent operation risk

### Attack Vector Detection
- **Code Injection**: Pattern detection for eval(), exec(), system() calls
- **Buffer Overflow**: Detection of unsafe string functions
- **Privilege Escalation**: Monitoring of privilege-related operations
- **Data Exfiltration**: Network activity anomaly detection
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrency safety analysis
- **Timing Attacks**: Execution timing pattern analysis

### Performance Metrics
- **Traditional Assessment**: <100μs average
- **Enhanced Assessment**: <1000μs with full ML pipeline
- **Memory Efficiency**: <100MB growth per 10,000 assessments
- **Accuracy**: Validated against known vulnerability patterns

## Integration with Existing Security Framework

### CSF-MLIR Security Integration
- Leverages existing `SecurityFramework` from csf-mlir
- Integrates with `CryptographicValidator` for integrity checks
- Uses `MemorySafetyMonitor` for resource tracking
- Connects to `ExecutionSandbox` for isolation

### Risk-Based Mitigation Strategies
- **None**: Low risk (score < 0.2) - Auto-approve
- **Canary**: Medium risk (0.2-0.5) - Gradual rollout
- **Shadow**: High risk (0.5-0.7) - Parallel validation
- **Manual**: Critical risk (>0.7) - Human approval required

## Test Coverage

### Performance Tests
- ✅ Sub-100μs assessment requirement validation
- ✅ Memory leak detection across 10,000+ iterations
- ✅ Concurrent assessment stress testing
- ✅ Various risk scenario benchmarking

### Functionality Tests
- ✅ Vulnerability pattern detection accuracy
- ✅ Threat vector assessment validation
- ✅ ML model prediction consistency
- ✅ Behavioral anomaly detection
- ✅ Risk factor weighting verification

### Security Tests
- ✅ Attack vector detection rates
- ✅ False positive/negative analysis
- ✅ Threat intelligence integration
- ✅ CVE database correlation
